A Note From Chris Albon

Dear Buyer,

These cards have been a labor of love for me for the last year. Each has been hand-drawn with art pens on 4x6 index cards, a process that was not without significant failures. The pile of books, pens, and cards on the my kitchen island has become a staple in my household and the basis of many fond memories with my toddler.

Thank you so much for purchasing them, I hope you find them as enjoyable as it was making them.
